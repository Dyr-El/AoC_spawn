# AoC_spawn

This is my template for doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in Jupyter Notebook.

The create_year.py is a script for creating 25 ready to go days of christmas for a year.
There are cli options for setting directory name, year and to force an overwrite.

The local_setting is for setting the session cookie so you can get the right input automagically.
It will also try to set proxy and do proxy authentication, but that does not work as it should, at
least not with my anaconda setup.
